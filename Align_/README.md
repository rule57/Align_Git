IGHT!!  RELEASE IN A COUPLE DAYS IF POSSIBLE (But not manditory)

So, the current goal is to make the app professional looking enough to be on the app store.
How we gon do that from what I can think of rn:

1. Remove the existing shit tutorial
2. Remove templates all together
    -For the first round of shit, lets just keep it as a camera tool, and no incentive for any goal yet
3. Populate the settings tab to some degree.  
    -easiest thing rn is to move the tutorial shit over there and make that button like a help button or smt
4. We gotta decide if GIF's are better than mp4s as the output
    -my argument for GIF's is that over text and on twitter they automatically loop which is beneficial for presentation outside of this platform
5. Removing "swipe up" if we cant figure it out
    -looks janky, should be intuitive enough without?
6. Get screenshots for the app preview on the app store
7. Optimize the ui of ViewController to be universal
    -Everything should be easy to get padding on it but i could be very very wrong (NOT MANDATORY)
